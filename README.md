Binary search is a search algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element with the target value. If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful. If the middle element is greater than the target, the search continues in the lower half of the interval. If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues in the upper half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search interval becomes empty. Binary search is efficient for large datasets as it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.
